## Scripts:

`extract-strings.sh` extracts all translatable strings from source files into pot-files. 

`upload-translations.sh` uploads the pot-files to crowdin

`export-en.sh` exports the English illustrations to png files with 140dpi, with and without transparent background.

These scripts rely on OmniGraffle and a set of [commandline tools](https://github.com/bboc/omnigraffle-export), both of which are currently only available on OS-X.
